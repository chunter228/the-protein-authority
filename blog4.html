  <h1>Ninja Creami and the Rise of Protein Ice Cream</h1>
  <p>One of the hottest kitchen gadgets on TikTok is the Ninja Creami, a countertop machine that turns protein shakes into creamy, ice‑cream‑like treats. Influencers pour in ready‑to‑drink shakes, freeze them overnight, then “spin” them into dessert the next day. It’s a tasty way to satisfy a sweet tooth while boosting protein intake.</p>
<p>This DIY protein ice cream craze reflects a larger trend: consumers want indulgent snacks that fit their macro goals. High‑protein product launches are booming【581753708187077†L117-L140】, and social media is driving innovation. But remember—adding candy mix‑ins can quickly turn a “healthy” treat into a calorie bomb.</p>
<p>To keep your Creami creations balanced, choose a low‑sugar shake like Koia as the base and stir in fruit or a spoonful of nut butter. You’ll get the creamy texture you crave plus fiber and healthy fats.</p>
