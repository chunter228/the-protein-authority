  <h1>Why Everyone's Talking About Protein Coffee</h1>
  <p>Scroll through social media and you’ll quickly encounter #Proffee—cold brew coffee blended with protein powder or ready‑to‑drink shakes. With 71% of Americans trying to eat more protein【568182238129158†L270-L332】, combining caffeine and protein seems like a genius time‑saver.</p>
<p>Adding protein to coffee may curb hunger and support muscle maintenance, but moderation is key. Many coffee shop creations are loaded with sugar and artificial flavors. Stick with unsweetened cold brew and mix in a high‑quality protein shake such as a plant‑based Koia, then add a dash of cinnamon or cocoa powder.</p>
<p>Remember that protein isn’t a magic bullet for weight loss. Experts say most people already meet their daily needs【639489652103378†L109-L156】; excess protein turns to calories. Enjoy proffee as part of a balanced diet—not a replacement for breakfast.</p>
