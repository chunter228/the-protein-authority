  <h1>From TikTok to the Gym: How Social Media Drives Protein Innovation</h1>
  <p>In today’s digital age, social media influences what we eat as much as who we follow at the gym. Nutrition trends like proffee, cottage cheese ‘ice cream’ and high‑protein wraps spread at lightning speed. Analysts note that mentions of protein in social media food posts exceed 10%【581753708187077†L117-L140】, showing just how obsessed we’ve become.</p>
<p>This virality has inspired brands to experiment with higher‑protein versions of everything—from cereal to pasta. Yet not all viral hacks are evidence‑based. As Johns Hopkins experts highlight, consumers should balance excitement with critical thinking and rely on science over hype【595822928387425†L91-L147】.</p>
<p>Our advice: enjoy the creativity but stick to the fundamentals. A varied diet rich in whole foods, regular exercise and a sprinkle of fun trends like Koia‑powered recipes will take you further than any fad.</p>
