  <h1>Smart Snacking: High‑Protein Snacks That Won't Sabotage Your Diet</h1>
  <p>Snack time doesn’t have to derail your nutrition goals. The key is choosing snacks that combine protein, fiber and healthy fats to keep you full. Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, hard‑boiled eggs and roasted chickpeas are excellent options that provide around 6‑15 grams of protein per serving.</p>
<p>Many Americans are adding protein to every snack and drink, but experts warn against crowding out other nutrients【568182238129158†L334-L343】. Pair your protein with produce—think apple slices with peanut butter or veggies with hummus—to maximize vitamins and minerals.</p>
<p>If you’re on the go, look for bars and shakes with simple ingredients and minimal added sugar. Plant‑based drinks like Koia deliver 18‑20 grams of protein plus fiber, making them a convenient emergency snack.</p>
