  <h1>The Science Behind Muscle Building: Protein Timing Explained</h1>
  <p>Protein timing is an enduring debate among gym‑goers. Do you need a shake immediately after training? Research suggests that total daily intake matters more than precise timing—so long as you distribute protein evenly across meals.</p>
<p>Aim for 20–30 grams per meal to stimulate muscle protein synthesis. Combining protein with carbohydrate after workouts helps replenish glycogen and accelerate recovery. Whole foods like salmon with sweet potato or tofu stir‑fry with rice can be just as effective as a shake.</p>
<p>Ultimately, consistency wins. If a post‑workout shake like Koia fits your schedule, go for it. If you’d rather have a full meal an hour later, that works too. Your muscles care about the big picture, not the minute‑by‑minute details.</p>
