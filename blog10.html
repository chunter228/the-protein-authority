  <h1>Meet Koia: A Delicious Plant‑Based Protein Shake You Need to Try</h1>
  <p>After you’ve explored powders and viral recipes, you might crave something simple. Koia is a ready‑to‑drink plant‑based shake made from pea, rice and chickpea protein that delivers around 18‑20 grams of protein per bottle. It’s dairy‑free, gluten‑free and low in sugar, making it an accessible choice for vegans and omnivores alike.</p>
<p>What sets Koia apart is its taste. While many plant‑based shakes can be chalky, Koia offers flavors like Vanilla Bean and Chocolate Banana that actually satisfy. Enjoy it on its own, blend it with coffee for a protein latte or pour it into your Ninja Creami for a high‑protein dessert.</p>
<p>As with any product, Koia should complement—not replace—whole foods. Use it on busy days or when you need a portable snack. It’s one more tool in your protein toolbox to help you meet your goals and enjoy the journey.</p>
